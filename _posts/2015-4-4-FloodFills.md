## The thing with flood fills.
In image editing software, you see paintbuckets all the time. 

In photoshop, for example, the paintbucket is the tool that fills in an area that share the same color.

Could the same thing be done on Processing?

### What are flood fills?
When you fill an area of a photo using a paintbucket tool, what are you doing?

According to [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=program+paintbucket&oq=program+paintbucket&aqs=chrome..69i57.2758j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=how+do+fill+tools+work), you are using a floodfill algorithm.

According to Wikipedia:
>Flood fill, also called seed fill, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. When applied on an image to fill a particular bounded area with color, it is also known as boundary fill.
