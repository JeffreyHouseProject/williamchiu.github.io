## Hello World! 
Thanks for reading my ramshackle attempt at "writing" a blog. Heres a little plot behind this wreck.

It's April 2nd, 2015. The next two months for many Trinity juniors are gruesome, filled with final papers, final presentations, final tests, final resting places, as well as final scrambles for standardized testing. I'm writing right now to keep this off my mind like I said I would earlier in the school year, when I had the luxury of free time. I recall ...having told myself? ... having told myself I would create a blog using Jekyll. I told my computer science teacher about it. I told a friend about it. However, I missed the memo.

Back then, around December or January, I also told myself I would be a purist. I saw templates of Jekyll websites. I brushed them off. [Who needs those, right?] (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
Apparently I do. [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) is amazing.
