## Hello World! 
Thanks for reading my ramshackle attempt at "writing" a blog. Heres a little introduction before you dive into this wreck.

At the beginning of the year, there was a grade meeting for the Juniors where we were told things like "you would be fine", "you dictate how well your year will be", and "junior year isn't that bad".

Part of me disagrees. Junior year is filled to the brim with stress for who knows what reason. In the coming months, there are oppressive loads of final exams, final presentations, and standardized testing.

Stress stress stress. Not to mention stress that school is still in session and that grades are still a thing. 
Stress that I probably would not understand a decade or two down the road. 

That is the part of me which agrees with what they say. Besides from the stress. Besides from my future-me's lack of empathy.. besides all that, the experience is fun.

I spent alot of time freaking out about tests. I complain alot, which is probably why I usually look bitter and unapproachable. 

However, the college app experience is pretty awesome in its own way. The prospect of having little time really serves as an incentive to do more things. I feel comfortable saying that this has been a productive year. I've tried hip hop classes, b-boy classes, baking, and now, with some luck, blogging.
