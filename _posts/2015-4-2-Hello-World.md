## Hello World! 
Heres a little introduction before you dive into this wreck.

At the beginning of the year, there was a grade meeting for the Juniors where we were told things like "you would be fine", "you dictate how well your year will go", and "junior year isn't that bad".

I disagree. Junior year is filled to the brim with stress for who knows what reason. 

In the coming months, there are oppressive loads of final exams, final presentations, and standardized testing.

Stress stress stress. Not to mention stress that school is still in session and that grades are still a thing. 

Besides from the stress. Besides from my future-me's lack of empathy.. besides all that, the experience is fun.

So guess I agree with what they said.. anyways..

Having little time serves as a strong incentive. I feel comfortable saying that this has been a productive year. I've tried hip hop classes, b-boy classes, baking, and now, with some luck, blogging.

Overall, trying new things is fun. As long as I could continue to do so in my junior year, I'll be happy.
