## Blogging with Jekyll

I planned to start a blog using Jekyll back in January. It's been on the backburner ever since.

Using Jekyll Now, the site was up and configured within 10 minutes. Overall, I'm shocked. Jekyll Now is easy and convenient, sure. More importantly, Jekyll Now looks hot. I see the 1.6 line height. I see the slight grays and the center alignment. CSS is spot on.
