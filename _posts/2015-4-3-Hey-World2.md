## Blogging with Jekyll

I planned to start a blog using Jekyll back in January. It's been on the backburner ever since.

Overall, I'm liking Jekyll. Jekyll Now is easy and convenient, but most importantly, looks hot. I see the 1.6 line height. I see the slight grays and the center alignment. CSS is spot on.

Anyways, since this is supposed to be a code-learning experience, I will probably adjust things to better suit my tastes.</br>
Small things.

••* line-height: 1.8;

Got to space out my lines a bit more.

••* mobile stuff bye.

I'll regret this later, but I felt like it.

••* padding around content... or is it margin?

Its crowded near the bottom.

Well, thats about it for this **morning**. I'll probably start posting some Processing snippets later today.
