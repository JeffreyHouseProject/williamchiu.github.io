## Blogging with Jekyll

I planned to start a blog using Jekyll back in January. It's been on the backburner ever since.

Overall, I'm liking Jekyll. 

I forked Jekyll Now to start the site. (Sue me)

I mean, dont. Jekyll Now is awesome. Jekyll Now is both easy and convenient, but most importantly, it looks hot. I see the 1.6 line height. I see the slight grays and the center alignment. That Jekyll Now CSS is spot on.

Anyways, since this is supposed to be a code-learning experience, I will probably adjust things to better suit my tastes.</br>

### Small things.

  * line-height: 1.8;

Got to space out my lines a bit more.

  * mobile stuff goes bye.

I'll regret this later, but I felt like it. It makes the code alot easier to skim through. Actually... no it doesnt.

  * padding around content... or is it margin?

Its crowded near the bottom.

...And thats about it for this **morning**. I'll probably start posting some Processing snippets later today.
